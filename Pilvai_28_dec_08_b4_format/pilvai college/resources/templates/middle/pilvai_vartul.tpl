        <td colspan="2">At present, this trifaculty college has 16 vartuls. Each subject has a vartul. The alumnus of each subject is the member of the subject of the vartul. Each departmental vartul runs a “Wall magazine”. This wall magazine contains creative articles, poetry and compiled items, which is equally proved useful to alumni. In addition to “Wall magazine”, a number of varied activities take place under the title of the Pilvai College Vartul, i.e. seminars, workshops, debate, elocution competition, poem reciting, shloka chanting, quiz, etc. Moreover, resource persons of the different subject are invited to deliver lectures; sometimes picnics and celebration of birthdays are enjoyed. The teachers provide a ‘generating force’ to these vartuls. At the end of the year, students, playing an active role in keeping the wheel of vartul moving smoothly, are duly awarded.</td>
