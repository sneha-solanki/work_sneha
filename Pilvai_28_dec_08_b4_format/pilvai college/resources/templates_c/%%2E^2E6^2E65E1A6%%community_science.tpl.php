Our principal, Dr.S.S.Shah, has taken up the gauntlet to spread science in society and especially among the rising generation. As a result of this foresight of his ambition, a dream of Community Science Centre has come true. The management and the staff has extended willing co-operation in getting it started. With the financial aid by Gujarat Council on Science and Technology (GUJCOST), a Taluka level Community Science Center (CSC) has been established at our college since April, 2004, and it has won an immense popularity and favour of the neighbouring educational institutions. </td>
